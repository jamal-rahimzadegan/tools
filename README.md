## Some useful `JS` based tools for day to day coding ☕

#### You just need to grab the desired `tool` from `src`.
* I have used React in this repo, and you can ignore it.


### These tools are included (and many will be coming soon ✌)
- **Numbers** 
- **Date (jalali)** 
- **Web Workers** 
- **Storage:** easily work with `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` and `Cookies`
- **API:** advanced wrapper for Axios (http-client)
